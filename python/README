Requirements:

Cython==0.23.4

To compile the Cython extension you have to run:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

A new forest can be trained by running:
python main.py <matlab data file> <forest file> [configuration file]
If the number of samples per image is <= 0, then all pixels in an image will be used for training.

A forest can be evaluated on a dataset by running:
python main_predict.py <matlab data file> <forest file>

=== Data file format ===

The data is given as a Matlab .MAT file with two fields: data, labels (default names, could be changed).
Both fields contains a 3-dimensional array of size WxHxN,
where N is the number of images, W is the width and H is the height of the images.
The arrays should be of type double.
