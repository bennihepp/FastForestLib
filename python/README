To compile the Cython extension you have to run:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

A new forest can be trained by running:
python main.py <matlab data file> <forest file> [configuration file]
If the number of samples per image is <= 0, then all pixels in an image will be used for training.

A forest can be evaluated on a dataset by running:
python main_predict.py <forest file> <matlab data file>
